DEEP FAKES DETECTION TECHNIQUES USING DEEP LEARNING
In today's digital age, social media platforms are flooded with images and videosâ€”many of which may be manipulated or fake. This project, titled Deepfake Detection Technique Using Deep Learning, aims to accurately differentiate between real and fake content. For videos, the system extracts frames, detects and crops faces, and then analyzes each using a trained deep learning model. For static images, the face is directly cropped and classified as real or fake. This technique helps in combating the spread of misinformation by ensuring content authenticity.

CREATE THE  PROJECT
